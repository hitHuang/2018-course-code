   Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical
   decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX
   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision
   making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates
   cars according to the following concept structure:

   CAR                      car acceptability
   . PRICE                  overall price
   . . buying               buying price
   . . maint                price of the maintenance
   . TECH                   technical characteristics
   . . COMFORT              comfort
   . . . doors              number of doors
   . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
   . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
   . . safety               estimated safety of the car
